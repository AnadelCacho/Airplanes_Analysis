# Airplanes_Analysis
Exploratory analysis and visualization (with pandas and seaborn) of a database of world airports.

This project consists of 4 different files: the Python notebook, its "html" version, a ".txt" file and a ".csv" file of Madrid-Barcelona.

The intention of the project is to analyze a large dataset of airport data from around the world (Europe, USA, Canada, South America, Australia and New Zealand). Geospatial analysis has been used to analyze airport data from all over the world. In addition, flights between different airports in North America and Spain can be visualized. The main objective of this section is to identify patterns and connections between airports, and to explore the relationship between airport location and number of flights.

2. Importance.
The project is important as it provides valuable information for the aviation and travel industry. The analysis of geospatial airport and flight data can aid in informed decision making regarding the construction of new airports and the optimization of existing flight routes. Additionally, the project can help identify patterns and connections between airports in different parts of the world, which can be useful for travel and tourism companies.

3. Methodology and Data Description.
The project utilized data analysis tools such as pandas and folium to manipulate and visualize large datasets efficiently. This approach can save valuable time and resources and provide useful information for decision making more quickly and efficiently.

The initial dataset includes 12,668 airports, of which 49 do not have information on cities. There are 241 countries represented in the dataset, with the United States having the highest number of airports. The latitude and longitude variables represent the geographic location of each airport, with the mean latitude indicating that most airports are located near the equator. The altitude variable represents the elevation of each airport, with the mean altitude indicating that most airports are at an altitude of about 832 meters above sea level. The standard deviation suggests that airport characteristics vary considerably. However, the original database has errors in some locations, indicating that the data requires further cleaning. The second-downloaded file on flight routes from the original database shows that direct flights to Spain from the United States are only made to Madrid and Barcelona, and vice versa.
